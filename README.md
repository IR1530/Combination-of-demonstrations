# Enhanced Prompt Retrieval for Text Classification
### Abstract
This dissertation introduces a novel pair-wise compatibility approach for enhancing prompt retrieval in text classification tasks, focusing on sentiment analysis. We develop a technique that evaluates the synergistic effects of example pairs, going beyond traditional semantic similarity measures. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy, particularly in achieving high recall rates.
### Key Features
Novel pair-wise compatibility method for prompt retrieval
Enhanced performance in sentiment analysis tasks
Comparative analysis with zero-shot, localized k-shot, and Rubin's approach
Insights into optimal context size for in-context learning

### Dataset
Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)

### Models Used
Sentence Transformer: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
LLaMA-2 (7B parameters)
